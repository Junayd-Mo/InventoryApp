This is an application I created as part of my A-level coursework in 2023. Its an inventory manager app that allows business owner to keep track of their stock including stock, cost, selling price and quantity at hand.
All this information is stored in a SQLite database.
User can edit the stock data in the 'edit' section where it also allows the user to delte any stocks that are no longer needed
The user can also update sales for any sales made during the day and can also be seen on a bar graph in the analysis section, comparing chosen stocks sales.
